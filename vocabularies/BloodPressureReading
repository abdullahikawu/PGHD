Blood pressure (BP) is the pressure of circulating blood against the walls of blood vessels.
Most of this pressure results from the heart pumping blood through the circulatory system. 
When used without qualification, the term "blood pressure" refers to the pressure in the large arteries. 
Blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure (maximum pressure during one heartbeat) over diastolic pressure (minimum pressure between two heartbeats) in the cardiac cycle. 
It is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) above the surrounding atmospheric pressure.
Blood pressure is one of the vital signs—together with respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature—that healthcare professionals use in evaluating a patient's health. 
Normal resting blood pressure, in an adult is approximately 120 millimetres of mercury (16 kPa) systolic over 80 millimetres of mercury (11 kPa) diastolic, denoted as "120/80 mmHg". 
Globally, the average blood pressure, age standardized, has remained about the same since 1975 to the present, at approx. 127/79 mmHg in men and 122/77 mmHg in women, although these average data mask significantly diverging regional trends.[1]
